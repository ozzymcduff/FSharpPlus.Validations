/// | An @AccValidation@ is either a value of the type @err@ or @a@, similar to 'Either'. However,
/// the 'Applicative' instance for @AccValidation@ /accumulates/ errors using a 'Semigroup' on @err@.
/// In contrast, the @Applicative@ for @Either@ returns only the first error.
///
/// A consequence of this is that @AccValidation@ has no 'Data.Functor.Bind.Bind' or 'Control.Monad.Monad' instance. This is because
/// such an instance would violate the law that a Monad's 'Control.Monad.ap' must equal the
/// @Applicative@'s 'Control.Applicative.<*>'
///
/// An example of typical usage can be found <https://github.com/qfpl/validation/blob/master/examples/src/Email.hs here>.
